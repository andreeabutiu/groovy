//provide an assertion an expression that evaluates to true
assert true

assert 1 == 1

def x = 1
assert x == 1

// what happens when the expression doesn't evaluate to true?
assert false

assert 1 == 2

assert 1 == (3+10)*100/5*20

//use shift operator to add a number to our list
def x1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
assert (x1<<6) == [6,7,8,9,10]
